âœ… Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture and the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern.
It separates concerns across layers to improve testability, maintainability, and scalability.

Layers:
	â€¢	Presentation: UI logic using MVP (View + Presenter)
	â€¢	Domain: Use cases and business models
	â€¢	Data: Network, caching, and external services (e.g. location, API)

ðŸ›  Minimum Deployment Target: iOS 11

After reviewing the existing TrackForce apps on the App Store, I noticed that some of them support iOS 11 and iOS 12.
To ensure compatibility with your user base, this app was built with iOS 11 as the minimum supported version.
